    <h2> Why I Joined the Alt School of Engineering Program?</h2>
    <p> I joined the School of Engineering program to strengthen my technical foundation and gain a deeper understanding of how the products <br>
        I help shape are built from the ground up. As a Product Manager, I believe that having a solid grasp of engineering principles will allow <br>
        to communicate more effectively with developers, make better product decisions, and ultimately deliver more impactful solutions. My goal is <br> 
        to grow into a product leader who bridges the gap between users and technology, someone who not only understands what to build, but also how <br>
        and why it should be built.</p>
